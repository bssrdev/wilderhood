<p>
Welcome back everyone, its been a thrilling week for me at a tiger reserve down South India. After watching the big four in the reserve, I am all charged up and rearing to go. Staying at the jungle surely energizes me. It was great to spent time and watch all the mammals and bird life that our pristine jungle has to offer. While heading back to Bangalore watched our bird of this week, many were sitting on top of trees, few other were gliding through the blue skies and also noticed one of them getting hit by a fast moving vehicle on ring road. 
</p>

<p>
Our bird of this week is Black-kite(Milvus migrans), they are medium-sized prey birds, head color is much lighter brown when compared to rest of their body. Around the eye its much darker brown patches are seen, coloring on the neck is also lighter brown. The end of the beak is yellow and bill is black. Wing tips have streaks of light brown against the dark black feathers, their tail is fork type and legs are yellow, talons are black. Male and female look alike. 
</p>

<p>
We can spot them almost every where in Bangalore gliding around searching for rodents, leftovers and scavenging on road kills or thrown away dead animals on the outskirts. Also seen around lakes feeding on fishes, smaller birds, chicks and occasionally on the herons as well. At Cubbon park have seen many people feeding them with pop corn, white bread crumbs and  other junk food. They also hunt down rock pigeons, bats at many parks, at Hoskote lake have observed them carry active Baya weaver nest and then feeding on their eggs.
</p>

<p>
Breeding is during late winter, nests are built on tall trees, materials are long twigs at a height of 30-40 feet. Male and female contribute equally in building the nest, males guard their mates aggressively from rouge males who wait for a chance and mate with unattended females. On an average two- three eggs are laid and both parents take care of the new-born, taking turns in hunting, nest is always guarded by either of the adults. Common crows present great threat for unattended eggs or chicks. Also group of crows have seen stealing prey from these kites. Other than group crows only Eagle owls prey on Black kites.

<p>
With decreasing tall trees around Bangalore, these birds prefer power lines and phone towers to scan the area. Long sitting on phone towers results in exposing to harmful radiation and instant dead in many cases. Electrocution is another means which has caused dead of these prey birds in large numbers. Trying to feed on road kills and getting hit by fast moving vehicles is another reason of death. Huge glass windows from tall industrial buildings reflect light blinding these high flying birds, which also results in them crashing into these windows. Feeding these birds with junk food might also have adverse affects on their health. 
</p>

<p>
Tall trees are very essential for these scavengers, which is essential for their hunting and nesting. Hence planting long growing trees around Bangalore is important. Electric wires with plastic coating will prevent these birds from getting electrocuted. Permission for phone towers around lake beds should be avoided. Feeding birds around parks should be strictly banned. With these few steps we could save these birds from getting into the vulnerable list. 
</p>

<p>Until next time. Keep watching!</p>
