<p>
Sirsi is a great place to visit during winters, one can spot all endemic birds and winter visitors. Early morning walk across a tiny muddy road resulted in as many as twenty plus birds and about six endemic birds. What we also observed was, many vehicles zooming on the road. After walking for a couple of hours, we saw huge trucks were also using the muddy roads which were part of the forest area. Then we came across this headless Sheildtail snake, my first encounter with this snake. It would have been great if I had seen it with its head and alive. Road kills are common in such areas, where mammals, reptiles and sometimes birds also get killed by speeding vehicles.
