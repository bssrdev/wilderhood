A few Wildlife Reserves allow night trails and it is great to go on night trails. That is when we will be able to observe predatory behaviors of many mammals. At Little Rann of Kutch we came across this incredibly camouflaged Sykes's nightjar! I have to note that, without our guide's spotting abilities, we would not have been able to spot this beauty. With the light from our guide's hand held torch, I crawled to get close to this nightjar. Making pictures in the dark is challenging, however since nightjars do not move much and are confident about their camouflage, I was able to make this image. Winter is a great time to visit Little Rann of Kutch.
