Coming down south, Bandipur Tiger Reserve is a great reserve to visit, tiger reserves in the south are open throughout the year. Though we know that summers are great time visit tiger reserves, monsoons are no less exciting. Saw these two young stags sizing up each other on our jeep safari, so we waited for a few minutes, couple of mock charges on each other and then they made one full fledged charge, this image was during one of those two mock charges. Later, one of them left the scene, with few bleeding scars on his neck, while the other stag grunted facing towards the females, celebrating this momentary victory.
