<p>
Well, wild encounters need not necessarily occur in the jungles. One early morning, during my birdwatching at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/Hosekote/">Hoskote</a>, searching for Red Munias led me to a few dogs feeding on the remains of a Cat, I just sat there for many hours watching these dogs rip this average size cat apart. After a week I visited the same site and at a couple of meters distance found the remains. Few people were still visiting this dead cat and the three stripes on its hind legs confirmed that this was indeed a Jungle cat! In nature, one would never know when to expect the unexpected. 

Hope you enjoyed these wildlife encounters with me, I extremely enjoyed sharing these experiences with you all!

Until next time keep watching!
