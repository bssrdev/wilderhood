Here is my first ever Tiger sighting in the wild! Amazing to see the majestic beauty in the wild amidst the beautiful meadows of Kanha. I could never forget this moment! 
</p>

<p>
After 5 safaris during November 2013, finally on my last Safari during my stay and had seen this Majestic beauty from far and after hide and seek in the bushes finally came out to give glimpse about 2 mins and I could manage to get 3 shots with 100-400 lens before she vanished in the bushes to join others
