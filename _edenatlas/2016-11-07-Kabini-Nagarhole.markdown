<blockquote>
Kabini and Nagarhole Park (from Veeranahosakalli gate operated by JLR Dubare) are quite familiar for Bangaloreans and Mysoreans and in most of them they say in their own words, Kabini is like second home to them! There is so much said about Kabini already in many posts so I would like to keep it simple and share my "Kabini - Never Disappoints" moments

<p>
Welcome to third edition of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/edenatlas" target="_blank">#edenatlas</a> and today's edition is about <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Kabini" target="_blank">Kabini</a>, Nagarhole National Park which is very popular and known as 'Land of Leopards' among wildlife enthusiasts and photographers.
</p>

<p>
It's been 3 visits so far to Kabini and Nagarhole National Park in the last season and once I have seen two tigers in one safari and could document the behaviour of Tigress patrolling the territory by sniffing the trees and Leopard on a tree canopy, every cat lover's dream shot and the third time a pack of wild dogs (4 of them) with lush green background post the rains. So, that would sum up what I am talking about (<em>'Kabini - Never Disappoints!'</em>)

There is beautiful backwaters which is equally famous for birding, and you'll sight lotsa raptors and osprey was a lifer for me!, though our naturalist in the boat didn't feel very excited like I do when we spotted!! :)

Well, now comes the interesting story of what happened in Nagarhole National Park! <a href="http://wilderhood.com" target="_blank">Wilderhood</a>, as part of corporate team outing, we have booked the 42 people from Intel to Nagarhole National Park. After pre-booking with JLR all permits to us and I know few of them missed out an opportunity to take safari that day! We had the entire resort, Jungle Inn booked for us for this #Crazy42. Post lunch, every one is waiting for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/basil.johannes" target="_blank">Basil</a>, Cheif Naturalist from JLR Dubare brought one canter and two gypsies to fit in all of our 42 people and headed for the safari. I am personally excited for the reason that 2 days before my arrival gaur killed by Tiger and followed on fb with long posts people sharing the amazing captures. Excited!! After all the formalities we entered inside the jungle, witnessed chithal (spotted deer), wild boars and Basil took us and stopped at the place where Gaur kill happened, as the Tigers have already dragged the kill inside we couldn't see anything but it stinks very bad with rotting smell of Gaur.
</p>

<p>
Upon moving ahead, it was a heavy rain with thunderstorms amidst the jungles. In no time, it's raining heavily and getting drenched in open canters (top covered!) and suddenly, our canter got stuck in the mud and unable to move! Everybody got down and we boys got into the job of pulling the canter but no luck. Canter is going deep inside the muddy patch and to my worry Aditi and few girls were standing under the tree amidst heavy rains and thunders! Another jeep of ours came to us and tried to help in but still no luck! Drivers got exchanged and with lotsa wood, stones and everything we tried to get the tire out from and finally it came out! Every one and every where we got drenched totally and could see people shivering and jumping out joy with first-time the wild experience!
</p>

<p>
Now Basil, moved to another vehicle our new naturalist asked us, whether to go back or still to experience the wild! To my surprise, everyone shouted <em>'Chale Tiger Dikhao humein!'</em> (Let's go and show us the Tiger). So we continued sighting sambar deer
</p>

<p>
And Here comes the one heck of sighting in my life, A pack of 4 wild dogs were in playful mood and one of them skidding from the log it trying to climb and amazing beautiful lavish green background just after the rains made my day! Subject very far and low light conditions couldn't make a decent picture but worth life time experience!!
</p>

<p>
Here I introduce you the #Crazy42
