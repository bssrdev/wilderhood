bio: "From a very young age I was always fascinated by wildlife!! Birds especially were an integral part of my life. I had to wait for my camera till I was 22 yrs old and there after I have tried to capture their beauty and show to the world about their importance in the natural world. My only aim of doing wildlife photography is to promote the goodness of CONSERVATION in whatever small way that is possible and to spread awareness about importance of wildlife for the ecosystem.  I have to thank my wife Julie, my daughters Andrea and Gloria for their co-operation in allowing me to disappear in to wild places very often and to enjoy what I like doing the most. I hope that you enjoy watching the photographs of Godâ€™s creations in their natural beauty as I did."
