bio: "An IT Consultant by profession, my heart lies in the world of travel and photography. Love for nature and traveling has been in my blood for as long as I can remember. Ever since I undertook the Naturalist Training program by Jungle Lodges and Resorts, my fascination for the natural world only grew exponentially and traveling to the wild a frequent affair. An affair that has taught me to observe and appreciate life around me as I have never done before. An affair that I hope will last a lifetime. My tryst with the wilderness began with my first trek to the tropical rainforests of Kudremukh in 2002. It was a trek through the heart of the Western Ghats traversing streams and waterfalls, bruising hands and legs sliding down mountain slopes, chased by a herd of Gaurs, losing trails and put up by a family we had never met before. What we assumed to be our last trek of our lives, turned out to be just the beginning."
