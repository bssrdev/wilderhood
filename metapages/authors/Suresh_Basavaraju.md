bio: "I have always had a passion for capturing moments on film. I tried my hand at portraits, street photography, and still life before realizing that my love for nature and photography could combine into a passion.

Over the years, my camera gear has changed depending on the work, technology, and the unique offerings from the major camera makers. I started with Yashica range-finder in the 1980's, moved to Pentax in 1992. With nature being the primary interest, moved to Nikon in 1997. 

Currently I use a mix of Nikon and Canon equipment. Nikon D4 with Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 500mm f/4G ED VR Lens  when I know my subjects well. Canon EOS-1D X with Canon EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Lens with Internal 1.4x   where subject to camera distance is beyond my control and I need a versatile lens."
