bio: "Being a passionate technologist and a nature lover and photographer, he was keen on perusing his passions. After spending nine years at his first job, he decided to follow his dreams by quitting his well paying job and taking on consulting, mentoring and photography. It was not an easy choice to walk away from the corporate comfort. But he did and co-founded BigLeap Solutions along with Manoj K in 2006 and to this day he is busy following his passions.
When not helping clients with their IT solutions, GT can be caught photographing nature, wildlife and landscapes. He is a passionate Naturalist. A photographer."
