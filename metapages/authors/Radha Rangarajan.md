bio: "“I love not man the less, but nature more..” – Lord Byron. Am a photographer and wildlife enthusiast. Writing on the last page of the notebook in school led to scribbling on sheets in college. Heck! I sat and wrote during my daily bus ride to college too. Now this blog bears the brunt of my rants. Here, I talk about the world as I see it and show the way my lens interprets the sights around me."
