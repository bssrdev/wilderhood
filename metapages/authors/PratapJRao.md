bio: "Over the years, I have made my interest in photography as wholesome as possible. I have been sharing photos on this website since its inception in 2006.  I have also made it a point to travel the length and breadth of India. In the process I have fallen in love with Himalayas, discovered a deep love for Landscape Photography, kept alive my interest for nature, and also professionally covered weddings and other events. My knowledge of photography is from this rich hands-on experience.

I am also a print maker, having started archival printing in Bangalore at a time when not many photogs were even aware of the term. Completely self-taught, I print with a Canon Pixma Pro9500, and Iâ€™ll be glad to show you my portfolio in prints. I also conduct photography workshops and tours. Keep visiting this site to see announcements about my future workshops.
