bio: "Photography began at a very young age of 10 when I was gifted a Kodak camera point & shoot camera. It used to come with a 36-slot reel. Shooting family portraits is how my love for Photography started. I am a jeweler by profession and photography is a passion today. I love to capture memories for a lifetime through the viewfinder. 

My discovery of the woods started as a teenager and I soon realized that I was not cut out for the club culture. My kind of holidays would be holidaying in the lap of nature. This is how my love for wildlife photography started and I decided to upgrade to a basic DSLR.

Every click evolves you as a photographer and hones your skills. So, I believe it is very important for a photographer to create that image in the head before clicking it. I respect professional full time photographers for it is no cake walk. You are in that mode all the time. I, being a part of a close-knitted family, would like to keep photography as a passion and a hobby.
