bio: "I am a wildlife photographer, filmmaker, naturalist and explorer specializing in environment, science and ecology in India. I freelance with many of the world's leading magazines, environmental NGOs and television channels like Nat Geo and BBC.

Over the last 8 years, I have worked on many landmark blue chip wildlife series for the BBC and National Geographic channel. My work has appeared in many publications worldwide, including National Geographic, Nature, The Guardian, BBC Wildlife, GEO, Smithsonian, Lonely Planet and other magazines. 

Along with a team of photographers I founded India Nature Watch, an online community which now has become the largest platform for upcoming wildlife photographers in Asia. Sharing my knowledge of photography, wildlife, and people across various platforms including workshops and seminars is an important part of the work I do. 

I collaborate with wildlife scientists, conservationists, policy makers, activists and educators on conservation action, activism, documentation, books and film projects. I actively work with Nature Conservation Foundation and VGKK in India. 

I hope to combine an artist’s eye with a journalist’s curiosity and sense of storytelling in my visual style, resulting in a body of work I hope will inspire the viewer to discover more. Using narrative and visual construction I strive to lure the audience into the subject, prompting them to ask questions rather than accept a ‘standard version’ of changing landscapes."
