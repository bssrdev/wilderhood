Something from <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Kutch" target="_blank">Little Rann of Kutch</a> this time..
</p>

<p>
We were told that if you want to spot desert foxes, you need to maintain pindrop silence and not even move a bit because they can hear noises so well.. 
</p>

<p>
It's so sensitive that they can even hear the underground moving scorpions..
</p>

<p>
While we were waiting outside the den, within few Seconds I started to hear snoring.. Feel sorry for them :)!
</p>

<p>
See you next week!
