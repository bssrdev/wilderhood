<p>
I was always fascinated about going to places after the shutterbug bit me in June 2013. That was when I’d started my photography journey at Agumbe rainforest with <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/organizer/Darter%20Photography" target="_blank">Darter Photography</a> (led by Shreeram M V). That led to a series of wildlife photography experiences, like trying out macro photography at <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Agumbe" target="_blank">Agumbe</a> (also known as the Cherrapunji of South India) and <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Goa" target="_blank">Chorla Ghats</a> in Goa, photographing majestic tigers at <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Kanha" target="_blank">Kanha</a> and <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Kabini" target="_blank">Kabini</a>, and photographing birds at <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Galibore" target="_blank">Galibore</a>, <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Valparai" target="_blank">Valparai</a>, <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Bharatpur" target="_blank">Bharatpur</a> and Rollapadu. When I heard of the tour to the most divine and exotic (in my opinion) place called <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Ladakh" target="_blank">Ladakh</a>, I immediately made up my mind to explore photographing Travel and Landscapes! I grabbed a seat on the tour, after <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/authors/Shreeram%20MV/">Shreeram</a> confirmed that he’s leading the tour.
</p>

<p>
And what a tour that was! Great experiences. Lots of photography. Many new friends. Here are a few glimpses of my Ladakh adventure...
</p>

<p>
Julley!! <h5>Welcome to Ladakh!</h5> After Day 1 was spent acclimatizing to the high altitude, we started our tour with a trip to Stakna Monastery. I clicked some of my favourite photographs from the tour here.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Idol in Stakna Monastery</h5> I photographed this at ISO 6400 as it was inside the monastery with very little light. And flash is not allowed.
</p>

<h5>Holy Water</h5> In Stakna Monastery.

<p>
<h5>Bactrian Camel in Sand Dunes</h5> Yes, Ladakh has sand dunes in Nubra Valley. We spent an evening there, and this camel modelled for us for a while.
</p>

<p>
Well, we've vivid memories of the bacterian camel in the trip and sure no one forgets after 2 full long years of trip? What do you say, my fellas? ;)
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/img/Ladakh/TwoMonks.jpg" alt="Two Monks walking on the sand dunes in Nubra Valley, Ladakh">

<p>
<h5>Monks on Sand Dunes</h5> While we were exploring the sand dunes, a couple of monks came along giving us good photography opportunities.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Maitreya Buddha at Thiksey Monastery.</h5> After Nubra Valley, our next destination was Pangong Tso. We stopped at Thiksey Gompa (or Monastery) – the largest Gompa in Central Ladakh – on the way. I photographed this at ISO 1600 (as it was indoors) and at f/8 so that the Buddha’s features are visible in addition to the flowers.
</p>


<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/img/Ladakh/ChildMonk.JPG" alt="Child Monk, Thiksey Monastrey, Ladakh">

<p>
<h5>Child Monk</h5> There was a prayer ceremony at Thiksey and many monks were there, including this young child.
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/img/Ladakh/Kashmir.JPG" alt="Kashmir with herds of Sheep, Thiksey Monastrey, Ladakh">

<p>
<h5>Herds of sheep</h5> On the drive from Leh to Pangong Tso, we came across many pastures with sheep grazing peacefully. And this image shows how I perceive Kashmir!
</p>

<p>
<h5>Pangong Tso!</h5> Finally, we got to every traveler’s dream destination.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Gull in Pangong Tso</h5> Well, I didn’t miss a chance to click wildlife there too :) We saw a lot of birds, like this Brown-headed Gull, despite the lake being a saltwater lake.
</p>

<p>
More will be in another post with Wilderhood Recitals on Wildlife at Pangong (very soon!).

<p>
<h5>Post-card View of Pangong Tso</h5> With amazing landscapes, I would definitely call this place <strong>Heaven on Earth.</strong>

<p>
<h5>Monk at Basgo Fort</h5> On our last day in Ladakh, we visited the historic Basgo Fort. We met a very friendly monk there who answered all our questions with a smile.
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/img/Ladakh/Confluence.JPG" alt="Confluence, Zanskar, Leh - Ladakh">

<p>
<h5>Confluence.</h5> Our last stop was the Indus-Zanskar confluence. It is a beautiful sight to see two rivers merging with the mountains all around.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Twilight</h5> All good things come to an end, they say. Our Ladakh trip ended after a week of traveling to beautiful places. But a new journey began – with great friends made on the tour.
