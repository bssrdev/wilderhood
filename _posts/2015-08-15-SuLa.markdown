In Dec 2014, <a href="http://recitals.wilderhood.com/authors/Shivakumar%20L%20Narayan" style="text-decoration:none">Shiva</a> and <a href="http://recitals.wilderhood.com/authors/Sriharsha%20Ganjam" style="text-decoration:none">Harsha</a> from <a href="http://landscape-wizards.com" style="text-decoration:none">Team LW</a> went on a amazing unseen Landscapes adventure to photograph the caves of Meghalaya in North Eastern region of the Indian Sub-continent.  Cave Photography is still in its infancy in India and this is probably the only professional work  done on photographing the hidden subterranean worlds in India. The accompanying 5 minute video gives you an insight into their amazing adventure and showcases the challenges and threats facing this sensitive and fragile eco-system.
