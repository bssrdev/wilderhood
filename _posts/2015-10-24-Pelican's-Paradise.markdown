<p>
Indeed, it was a paradise of Spot-Billed Pelicans. The location - <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/Madiwala%20Lake">Madiwala Lake</a>, Bengaluru. Though I pass through this lake to my work place, I never had been inside the park premises to do a bird count. I should thank my cab driver who repeatedly asked me to visit the lake. He also told me about boating. Finally, me and my friends visited this lake and were astonished.
</p>

<p>
With few inputs about boating and park entry from a fellow birder, we reached the lake by 8-30 AM hoping to get into boats. This lake is being maintained by forest department. 
</p>

<p>
The boating counter was opened by 10 AM, though it was put up that it starts from 9 AM. They are so damn punctual..!!
</p>

<p>
Left side of the park is clean, the guards were cleaning the plastic trash. However, the right side of the park was filthy, mainly because of fishing. The lake water was obviously polluted, I could see dead fishes near to shore. Many were using traditional techniques to fish. 
</p>

<p>
We took the tickets and hopped into a paddle boat. Thus began an awesome waterfowl expedition.

<p>
Boating at Madiwala lake is worth every penny. Pelicans were friendly, they were so close to our boat. We did not bother them at all. They showcased themselves as we clicked continuously.

<p>
Pelicans head count had come down when we went to the lake, there were about 80. Apparently the count was about 180 at the start of the season, mainly breeding. Adult pelicans were teaching the young ones how to wade through the still water and find food.

<p>
Pelicans are mighty birds. With broad wing span and a spotty long bill, they have a distinguished way to catch fish.

<p>
Apart from pelicans, we saw plenty of other aquatic birds. Everything was up-close. It was very nice to see them preening, feeding young ones, wading through silent water, flying here and there.
