<p><em>This one been my first Lion spotting in the wild and first shot ever, always been special to me!!!</em></p>

<p>Raju, is his name and truly had his life like a king, always lived in Solitude (Lions are the only animals among Big Cats live in groups, called Pride groups) and been nomad for times! Usually Lions move out and form their own pride group by the age 3-4.</p>

<p>One of the most handsome and famous male in the Gir Sanctuary. As per <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Majestic-Lions-of-Gir/1443484369280229">"The Majestic Lions of Gir"</a>
<blockquote>His character is as famous as "Sultan Mirza". Different lion claimed different area as their territory but the Raju always said one line "Aap log ka jungle mein hissa hai but yeh jungle mera ek hissa hain"</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Coming back to details on my sighting that day, when we entered Gir National Park on our first safari and it was still dark and couldn't see anything! And that's when our jeeps noticed a movement right next to the route and our big guy was resting there! Looks like, few jeeps left before us have missed out.</p>

<p>Amazing experience, it was, for me!!! Watching a Lion in the wild for the first time and such a close distance</p>

<p>Yawning, relaxing, lazy buggers, I thought to myself!! Wait!!! there is something on his left-eye and have noticed he is been very badly injured!</p>

<p>Enquired, our guide explained us the brawl occured between the three other male lions in the pride, who de-throned  and thrown him out from his own territory, which is happened on the day just before we landed!</p>

<p>Rules of the Jungle, I told myself!!</p>
