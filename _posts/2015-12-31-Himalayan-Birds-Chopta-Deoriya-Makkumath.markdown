As we move from Makku to Deoria Taal on a road that has seen the first vehicle in the past 12 hours, flocks of Kalij Pheasants busily chewing on juicy insects and grains cross our path, the air is chilly with temperatures dropping to below 0 degrees at night. Earlier in the morning we were greeted by the melodious morning call of the Blue Whistling Thrush, followed later by House Sparrows, Russets Sparrows, flocks of Spotted Doves, a lone Grey Treepie and a friendly Grey Bushchat very near to our stay.

I get down 4 kms before Deoria Taal and take a trek,the trek is a very pleasing, relaxing and a refreshing one amidst the high altitude Pine and Deodar Trees. Until they are disturbed by my presence, a pair of spotted forktails are busy, foraging for food in a small stream that flows very close to the roadside. Oblivious to my presence some Green backed Tits sing their beautiful songs hopping from tree to tree and Warblers are busy eating flying insects at a speed that is blindingly fast. Further down, a Himalayan Buzzard is flying very close to the road, above barren fields, searching for its next prey.

After a good lunch and some rest, it is time to explore a different area. Taking cue from some local villagers and hoping to get a clean shot of the Himalaya Buzzard seen earlier, I trek amidst some barren fields and see the Buzzard flying on a distant patch of land (well disappointment), I trek further and suddenly a group of birds fly away and perch to a tree, carefully approaching the tree I see a number of Russets Sparrow, Stone chats, Rock Buntings (Male and female), a Chestnut bellied Rockthrush and some birds which I could neither shoot nor ID. The next few hours pass in carefully stalking and approaching the tree (which was not very fruitful :)!)

It’s a stark contrast Day and Night have in the remote Himalayas of Uttarakhand, while the day is filled with melodious calls of beautiful song birds, the constant babbling of babblers, the different alarm calls of Pheasants, the very sweet and constant calls of the Barbets, the only call which one might hear in the night is an occasional and a very high pitched alarm call of a Barking deer or a Sambhar

Its morning and I begin my trek towards Deoria taal, can hear (and later see)  Brown fronted Woodpeckers, Himalayan Woodpeckers, busily pecking along the tree trunks looking for Insects.  Black-throated bushtits, lots of Rufous breasted accentors, small groups of Blue-capped redstarts flying very erratically over the landscape, very beautiful and extremely shy Chestnut-crowned Laughing thrush which will not give you a clean shot, no matter how much one waits.

Variegated Laughing-thrushes hop very discreetly in dense branches of small shrubs and trees, large groups of White-throated laughing-thrushes very nosily forage the dead leaves for food, some Chestnut-Bellied Nuthatches hop vertically along the tree trunks foraging for Insects. Black headed Jays and the Elusive and Shy Eurasian Jays hop along the path. Amidst all these rambling and babbling, a lone Lemmergier and some Himalayan Vultures, fly very gracefully and silently in the sky looking for some dead meat. Deoria taal has already had some snow fall and after shooting the sunset and resting for the night, exploring the area for one more day with the local villagers, the third day I move towards Chopta and adjoining area.

Makku Bend is a very famous birding stop, and I stay here for the next 2 nights, hoping to get some different birds and good shots. I am rewarded handsomely in that I see a number birds that I have never seen before, and get a lot of Lifers. There was snowfall some days back in Chopta and roads are since closed (or only some skilled drivers can drive through), I have the whole region for myself and I am handsomely rewarded in that fact that I get to see a lot of , and capture some of Lifers. Flocks of Grey winged Blackbirds,  Rufous bellied Woodpecker, Coal tits, Grey crested tits, Snow Pigeons, Orioles, White collared Blackbirds, Grey Headed Woodpeckers, Black Bulbuls, Yellownapes, Laughing thrushes, Greenfinches ,Yuhinas and a lot more birds adorn the Jungles of Chopta and the regions around. Calls of Himalayan Monals can be heard in abundance and though I do get a fleeting glimpse of them on two occasions, I could not shoot them.

<p>
We will be capturing a lot of these and many more beautiful birds in our week long Himalayan Birding camp of Chopta, Deoriya and Makkumath in the Month of Jan 2016. You can check the expedition details <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/trip/Makkumath-An%20Unexplored%20Birding%20Paradise" target="_blank">here.</a>

The next 2 days pass by in a flash, I don’t want to go back from there, but i have to, and with an extremely heavy heart and some beautiful memories, I bid goodbye to this small piece of birding heaven (which the Himalayas fortunately have lots of them) promising to come back again.

<p>
Below is the check list of the birds which I could record during my trip here.

There were a lot of birds which i could hear and sadly, not identify and lots which I could see but got no shots and hence cannot ID it. I will keep updating this list as and when I am able to add more birds.
