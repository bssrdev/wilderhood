"Where do we go now, my search is exhausted", I said. She replied- "Why should not we try Agumbe, we have never been there". I was like - "Why didn't I think about this place earlier..!!!".

I nodded and told her about <strong>Ajji mane</strong> in <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Agumbe" target="_blank">Agumbe</a>. It seemed interesting to her! So, we decided to visit this place to celebrate our wedding anniversary!
</p>

Agumbe is a small hamlet located just 20 kms away from Sringeri. With the amount of rain it receives during the monsoon, this place is otherwise known as <em>Cheerapunji of South</em>. Civilization is surrounded by thick evergreen forests with river source <em>"Sita"</em>. Sunset point at the start of Agumbe Ghat attracts tourists from different parts of India. During monsoon, nature lovers throng Agumbe to experience continuous rain and vivid colors of flora and fauna.

This legendary house has a lot to speak. This is where episodes of Swamy and his friends of infamous Malgudi days was shot. This is where Kiccha Sudeepa's My autograph was shot. Apart from all these cine facts, what caught my attention was Kasturi Ajji and her family's selfless deeds. Her family has been catering traveler's needs since decades. She prepares food and offers shelter in her ancestral big house for anyone who wishes to spend sometime at Agumbe. What a noble work!  
</p>

<p>
With much eagerness and anticipation we visited this place after a brief break at pious place Sringeri.

I was amused looking at the architecture of Dodda Mane. Such a big house with sturdy pillars, spacious rooms, a large open space to hang out with people. If you feel bored of sitting, you could dive in fresh water just across the road or go bird watching, which is even better.!
</p>

<p>
I went in search of avian beauties around Dodda Mane and Jogi Gundi road. Trust me, it was one of the best birding experience.! Whistling thrush's melodious song, grey hornbill's call, Pitta's guest appearance, hopping of orange headed thrush, woodpecker's noise..and many more!

Agumbe is a great place for birding, herping, and macro photography and many more adventure activities. If you have plans to visit Agumbe I certainly recommend a night stay at Dodda mane to relish delicious food and friendly hospitality!
