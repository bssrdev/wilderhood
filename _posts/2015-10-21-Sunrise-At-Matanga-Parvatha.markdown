<p>
Landscape photography can be hard work and only sometimes all the efforts pay off. During my visit to Hampi this past weekend, along with a bunch of photographers led by Arun Bhat from <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/organizer/Darter%20Photography" target="_blank">Darter Photography</a>, we woke up around 4:45 am, got ready by 5:30 am and left for Matanga Parvatha. It is a 20 – 30 minute hike up along the steep steps to the top of <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/destination/Hampi" target="_blank">Matanga Parvatha</a>, which is the tallest hill around the Hampi ruins. We had to do all of this in-order to ensure we were well in time for the main show to begin i.e. sunrise over Hampi. This time around, I did not climb all the way to the top of the hill, but stopped at a clear landing, about 20 mts below the hill top, in order to photography scenery  on the south/south-eastern portions around the Matanga Parvatha.

Here are some of the shots made during this fantastic natural event.
