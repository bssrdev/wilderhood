<p>Whenever I show my landscape images to my friends, they say : ‘ Wow! It must be a very beautiful place ! ‘. That expression is almost certain if the image is of a waterfall. But, less often than not, they ask me ‘ By the way, how big is the waterfall? ‘ and I really appreciate people who ask me that question! Most of the people get carried away by the colours and beauty of the place, whereas only a handful of them think about the size of it and try to see the image from a representational angle. This post is dedicated to my second category of friends.</p>

<p>With a mere beautiful photograph of a landscape, it is often difficult to judge the enormity of the place. Sometimes even if we include a tree or a rock to give some sense of scale, the purpose will not be truly served. This is because, the viewer may not know how big the tree was or how large the rock was. There are big trees and there are small ones, this holds true for rocks as well. So the question still stands at – how big was it in reality in relation to what is depicted in the image?</p>

<p>For instance, in the above image, it may be difficult to judge the size of the stream though there is a rock in the frame. Same may be the case with the image below also. In both of these images though there are rocks in the image, it is difficult to guess the size of the rock and hence it is difficult to grasp the size of the stream.</p>

<p>Either in the above beautiful image of Jenukal Gudda or in the below wonderful image of Vibhooti falls, though there are trees in the image,  it becomes difficult to perceive its size and there by the scale of the whole scene or judge the height of the waterfall.</p>

<p>It is not a crime when one does not give a reality view where size can be interpreted. But sometimes it is important, as it adds a different dimension to the image and the viewer will get a relative perspective and this outlook  can create an everlasting impact on the viewer’s mind.</p>

<p>My analysis:  The best way to portray the size is to include something that has a definite size to which we can relate to. The best way I would suggest is to include humans – though the body surface area varies from XS to XXL, when viewed in relation to a large landscape it is easier to grasp the enormity of the landscape. They make an excellent element to give the sense of size to the whole picture. If you take your dog along with you, then you can think about including them as well.</p>

<p>In my previous blogs (http://www.landscape-wizards.com/home/inspired-landscapes/why-visit-the-same-place-again and http://www.landscape-wizards.com/home/inspired-landscapes/yes-i-went-to-sathoddi-again) the images have the same problem.  Hence I decided to give readers this post, giving a sense of height of the falls, so that they can relate to other images from the same place.</p>

<p>Below are the images giving a comparative perspective of landscapes with and without humans and I am sure you can gauge the size of the waterfall in the last two images.</p>
