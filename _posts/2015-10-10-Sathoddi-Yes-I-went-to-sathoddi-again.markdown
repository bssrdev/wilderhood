<p>In my earlier blog about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/09/30/Sathoddi-Falls-Why-visit-the-same-place-again.html" target="_blank">Why visit the same place again?</a> I had mentioned my reason of visiting a place over and over. At the end of the blog post I had indicated that I would surely be visiting Sathoddi again in the future and I was sure that it would throw one or the other surprises.</p>


<p>Few months back it happened again. I was there to witness the beauty of the falls again. This time it was the end of summer and the first showers were yet to wet the ground. The water was almost at its lowest but flowing. </p>

<p>I found it little difficult in the beginning to come out from the traditional shots and it took some real good amount of time before I zeroed in onto a place which was giving me a different perspective of the falls. </p>

<p>For me this was indeed a very different perspective of Sathoddi which I had never got earlier or rather I had not seen earlier. This was possible because of low level of water which allowed me to cross some rocks and made possible to get to a point from which this view was visible. In monsoon or in winter it is just impossible to get this viewpoint because of rise in the water level. </p>

<p>And this has motivated me again to visit the place again in some other different time or season.</p>

<p><strong>When next??</strong> I donâ€™t know, but I will for sure! In some different season, for some different reason.</p>
