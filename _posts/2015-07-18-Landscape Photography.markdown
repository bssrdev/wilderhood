<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>I know the title sounds surprising, but it actually is true!</p>

<p>People may think that making images of Lions and Tigers in the wild is dangerous. Whereas landscape photography on the other hand, is thought to be all about shooting pretty flower filled pastures with ease.. Then what could be so dangerous about it? What many people fail to grasp is that a landscape image is memorable only if you showcase a pretty scene in an unusual perspective. The challenges involved in  achieving  a perspective that “unusual”  in a Landscape image is sometimes much more intense and harder than any other form of nature photography. Let me support my theory with key parameters which every photographer will agree.</p>

<p>Exposure to the elements –This point comes primarily from the fact that a landscape photographer is more exposed to the elements than a wildlife photographer. A wildlife photographer is usually on a safari jeep during photo shoots and this vehicle acts a safety barrier protecting him and his equipments from any unexpected danger unless the photographer is hasty enough to fall off the jeep. A landscape photographer on the other hand, more often than not has to be on foot and experience the real terrain for a momentous image. And when one is on foot walking mountain trails to capture that beautiful sunrise or kneeling on slippery rocks to get that lovely waterfall, one is always at risk. I personally have had two nasty falls, once on slippery rocks near Dudhsagar and the second one on some loose gravel at Ladakh.</p>

<p>Timings – Landscape photographers treasure images made in a fading light or lowlight conditions when the sky exhibit the most spectacular colours. Sunrise and sunsets have always fascinated us, and to get a sunrise from a hill top usually means trekking in the dead of the night to reach the top before the sun comes out, it is the same for a sunset seeker where he has to deal with walking back after the sun has set. While a wildlife photographer also needs to be up at the crack of dawn or staying out until the sunset, to get those special moments, he is at a lesser risk of either stumbling in the dark or getting bitten by an animal which you did not realize was hiding in the dark. I once had to trek to the bottom of a waterfall in pitch darkness on very slippery terrain at 4:30 AM to make some images of the fall with the stars shining on top of it. It was an unforgettable and terrifying ordeal to say the least. Also going out at unreasonable times into the wild can sometimes attract unwanted attention.</p>

<p>Equipment safety- We all have made significant investment in our equipment and take pride in them. While a wildlife photographer only worries about his equipment we landscape guys have more to worry about, our personal safety! Nobody wants to let go of his equipment, but believe me that isexactly what one would do when gravity decides to flex its muscles against you. I once had my entire camera setup washed away and I lost balance on my feet. This happened when I was trying to make some slow shutter images of a stream in Bhadra Tiger Reserve, I had failed to judge the power of the current. Also shooting scapes near the sea is always a tricky subject to handle due to sand and salt. One of my close friends even dropped his lens in Sea water while changing his lens!</p>

<p>All said, there can be no substitute for careful execution and taking responsible measures when out in the field. Below I have listed a few points which in my opinion must be followed by all photographers going out into the wild and especially if you are a keen landscape enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The camera strap is your best friend – Have it around your neck all the time. You will be thankful for this simple and free accessory instead of cursing the fate when you drop it.</p>

<p>Have a powerful light source – A torch with a powerful beam is always helpful when you have to tackle low light situations. Always ensure the torch is in working condition before any trip, because you never know how long you may need it for.</p>

<p>Keep people informed – Always let people know your plans and when they can expect you to be back, keep the mobile phone charged and inform your contacts if you are going out of network coverage area. If possible also take someone along with you to give you company.</p>

<p>Expect the unexpected – When out in the open always keep all the options open. Make sure both you and your equipment are adequately dressed to tackle the capricious weather and also keep a small water bottle and a small snack.</p>

<p>Be well informed – It always pays to know where the next nearest town is or the weather forecast for the next couple of days or the sunrise and sunset time. Carryout a basic research if you are going somewhere new and handover a detailed itinerary to your contacts back home if possible.</p>

<p>Follow the rules – Rules exist for a reason. Abide by them to extract the maximum out of your trip, if you need special permits then do not attempt the shots without getting those permits. Always respect your subjects and the nature in front of you and please be reasonable to the place and people. Good ethics takes a person a very long way.</p>
