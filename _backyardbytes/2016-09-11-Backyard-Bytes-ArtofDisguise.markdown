Beauty of Backyard Macro photography is that you tend to discover new things in a place which we consider to know very well. Holding the camera with intention to shoot Macros can throw many surprises, Just like the one in this picture.

We all know how the animals use Camouflage to survive. But this for me was in next level. From distance it was just a leaf, it was leaf from closer distance too!!  But in reality a green insect (Name/ID unknown to me, please comment if you know this fella) beautifully occupied edge/tip of the leaf.  It was amazing scene, it was hard to believe that leaf was not just a leaf!
