<p>
String of spider web is said to be as strong as that of a steal thread of same thickness. Read on if you don't agree!! Here the invincible string was holding a falling flower; I was capturing the flower which was swaying in all directions due to wind. To my surprise flower got a visitor in Bee! All this in heavy downpour of peak Western Ghats monsoon. If you watch closely you will also see a drop of water on the flower. In short its holding a flower, bee, water drop in a windy rainy day!! And we just call it a string even when it is so <strong>“STRONG”!</strong>
