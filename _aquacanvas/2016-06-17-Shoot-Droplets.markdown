<p>
Welcome to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aquacanvas" target="_blank">'Aqua Canvas'</a>, and let me introduce you some tips and tricks on shooting techniques on capturing the beautiful images with water before you venture out to your favourite rainforest and <a href="http://www.wilderhood.com/category/Monsoon%20Destinations" target="_blank">monsoon destination</a> this season!

This is a close up of a water droplet suspended in air. It was taken with a Canon 100mm macro lens and a simple home setup.

<p>
It takes plenty of retries to get the perfect water droplet photo. Timing is essential. It helps to have an external flash. An external flash helps to highlight the water droplet.

<p>
This image was shot at <em>f/6.3, at ISO 100 and a shutter speed of 1/200</em>. It is essential to have a fast shutter speed to <em>‘freeze’</em> the droplet. 
</p>

<p>
Another way of ‘freezing’ water droplets is taking a closeup of water droplets.

This photo was taken in the monsoon. Water was trickling down from the roof, so it was easy to pick a spot where the water droplets where hitting the ground.

<p>
You can practise freezing droplets of water either indoors at home, or outdoors during the rain. Monsoon is around the corner, so this definitely gives an oppurtunity to do both. When it rains heavily and you cannot go out, make a water drop setup indoors and try to freeze the droplets. When there is light rain, go out and try to  freeze the droplets!
