<p>
Welcome back to fourth week of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aquacanvas" target="_blank">'Aqua Canvas'</a>. We'll learn about how to shoot with Natural surroundings!
</p>

<p>
One of the easiest ways to capture the glory of water is to shoot a waterfall or the ocean in its natural surroundings.  This might require you to hike a little to go in search of pristine locations, but thatâ€™s the fun of photography! 
</p>

<p>
When it comes to shooting waterfalls, even a telephoto lens will come of good use. I shot the above photo at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/10/10/Sathoddi-Yes-I-went-to-sathoddi-again.html" target="_blank">Sathodi falls</a> using a <em>70-200mm lens at 70mm</em>. My goal was to capture the water against the rocks and vegetation.

<p>
In the below image, I have used an ultra wide angle lens to capture the rocky surroundings near the ocean. Shooting at sunset helped me capture vivid colors in the sky.  I did not bother <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aquacanvas/2016-06-24-Silky-Smooth-waterfall.html" target="_blank">slowing down the shutter speed</a>, because I intended to show how turbulent the water was!
